AASB - Algorithms for the Analysis of Biological Sequences<br>
Masters in Bioinformatics, University of Minho (2021-2022)


## Description
A _Python_ package implementing some basic functionality relevant to the
manipulation and analysis of biological sequences. Among others, features
such as a simple version of _BLAST_ (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) and
an an interface for performing sequence alignments (simple and multiple) are
provided.

## Modules
- _class_align.py_ - local and global aligments of DNA and protein sequences
- _class_blast.py_ - simplified version of _BLAST_
- _class_dotplot.py_ - identification of regions of close similarity between sequences
- _class_enzymes.py_ - identification of restriction sites within a DNA sequence
- _class_motifs.py_ - probablistic models of motifs (PWM and PSSM)
- _class_mult_align.py_ - multiple alignments of DNA sequences
- _class_seq.py_ - basic functionality for the analysis of DNA sequences
- _nw_glob_align.py_ - improved version of global alignments (allows for ties)
